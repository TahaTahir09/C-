Sudoku Game Project in C++
I am excited to share one of my recent projects - a Sudoku game developed in C++. This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply basic programming skills and create a functional console-based game.

Project Overview:
The Sudoku game is a classic puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 grids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. Here are the key features and aspects of the project:

Key Features:
Game Initialization:

The game initializes a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid.
Players can choose to start a new game or load a saved game from a file.
User Input and Validation:

Players can input numbers into the grid using simple commands.
The game validates the player's input to ensure it follows Sudoku rules.
Game Logic:

Implemented using loops and conditionals to check for valid moves.
Provides real-time feedback on whether the move is valid or not.
Saving and Loading:

Players can save their current game state to a file.
Load a previously saved game to continue playing.
Console-Based UI:

Simple and intuitive console interface for interacting with the game.
Displays the current state of the Sudoku grid after each move.
Technologies and Skills Used:
Programming Language: C++
Core Concepts: Loops, conditionals, file handling, and basic console I/O.
Development Environment: Visual Studio, GCC, or any standard C++ compiler.
Learning and Impact:
This project allowed me to:

Enhance Problem-Solving Skills: Developing the game logic required careful planning and problem-solving, particularly for validating moves and ensuring the rules of Sudoku were adhered to.
Improve Code Organization: Managing different aspects of the game, such as input validation, game state management, and file operations, helped improve my ability to write organized and maintainable code.
Gain Practical Experience: Working on this project provided practical experience with fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and file handling.
